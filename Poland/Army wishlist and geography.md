Geography, Western front
==========
These are the terrain types along the front lines (on the Polish or allied side), and all terrain in the enemy states (unless it is already included in other)

North-Western front (Pommern + Preussen, Second Polish offensive)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* 70w           Plain: 7+14  : 33%
* 60w atk-15% Forrest: 22+15 : 58% 
* 70w atk-25%   Hills: 0+1   : 1.5%
* 80w atk-30%   Urban: 2+2   : 6%

Average combat width: 64, median combat width 60, prioritize Forrest movement and attack

Best line infantry: 20 width line infantry with 3 regiments, rangers, engineers, artillery and aa-optionally drop rangers or keep cavalry recon
Costs only 5 xp (on top of silesian line infantry)
40xp in total

Alternative: Armored line infantry: Replace one battalion with a light tank battalion (Too high xp cost though)

Shock troopers: Armored dragoons: 8 Cavalry battalions, rangers, engineers, artillery and aa
95xp design cost: additionally
7TP: costs 2xp in the cheapest configuration, 12xp in full version
rangers cost 60xp to unlock

Frontline: 21

Schlesien front (First Czech and Polish offensive)
--------------------------------------------------
* 70w         Plain   : 11 34%
* 60w atk-15% Forrest : 7  22%
* 70w atk-25% Hill    : 9  28%
* 80w atk-30% Urban   : 3   9%
* 50w atk-50% Mountain: 2   6%

Average combat width: 66, median combat width 70

Frontline: 17

Best Line infantry: 18 Width line-infantry divisions, with 3 Regiments, and Ranger, engineers, Artillery and AA Companies
Cost 35 xp or 45 xp (more if rangers are used)

Shock troopers: 24 width mountain-infantry: Armoured Mountaineers: 8 Mountain Infantry battalions, 2 regular battalions, 2 light tank battalions (7TP light tanks with Automatic cannons), Engineers, Rangers, support artillery and AA companies
80xp
Can afford 6 shock troopers

Sudetenland front (Czech and Slovak border, and Sachsen Bayern+Austria North of Donau)
-----------------
* Hill 20
* Urban 4
* plain 10       
* Forrest 17
* Mountain 1

Same template as Schlesien

Baltic front 
------------
* Hill 1
* plain 6
* Marsh 7
* Forrest 31

Same template as Preussen

Belarusian front
----------------
* 70w plain 19
* 50w -40% atk Marsh 17
* 60w Forrest 11

The best strategy is to ignore this place, maybe use dedicated 24 width line infantry to hold (+5 xp)

Ukrainian front
---------------
* plain 33
* Marsh 4
* Hills 2
* Forrest 8

Use Schlesian line infantry, and 18 width cav+armor (consider researching and using medium tanks)
Add logistics companies or maintainance or flame-tanks once unlocked

Frontline-lengths
-------------------
* Polish Western front: 13
* Preussen Front 15
* Sudetenland: 24
* Baltic Front 7
* Polish Eastern front 17
* Dnistr Front 8

* Total western front: 52 (Poland+Baltic: 28 Czechoslovak: 24)
* Western Front, (if Schlesien and Preussen offensive succeed): 26 (Poland: 9 , Czechoslovak: 17)
* Eastern Front: 32

An Army for 1938
================
There will be 3 or 4 types of divisions in the Polish army of 1938:

Silesian/Hill Line Infantry ideally 4 per province: 68 (17 provinces)
cost 35 xp
Prussian/Forrest Line infantry 63 (21 provinces), alternatively add another 51 and skip Silesian line infantry
cost 5 xp

3 divisions per province is ideal, but might not be realistic, at the very least 2 per province: 76 divisions

Elite Hill infantry: ideally 6 to fill 2 70 width battles
cost 80xp + 60 for rangers +12 for tanks
Elite Hussars: as many as possible aiming for 4
cost 95xp

Estimated cost: 
* 2820 Support equipment
* 1760 Anti Aircraft guns
* 1056 Howitzers
* 90560 Infantry squad equipment
* 1440 Light Tanks


A decent stockpile of trains and trucks is a good idea as well aim for 15 to 30 armored trains, and 100 supply trucks


An army for 1940
================
With the Soviet invasion, many changes need to be made

Light tanks should be replaced by medium tanks, we must research 1938 medium and artillery II to produce the 10TP fast

Production of modern trucks should be ramped up.

The research of AA II is important, Modern smallarms is less critical (given the cost and steel), researching supply companies is a good idea

Air-research would be useful: skip directly to improved planes
